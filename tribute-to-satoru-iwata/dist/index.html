    <h3>Life and times of Iwata-San</h3>
    <p>Iwata was born on December 6, 1959, and raised in Sapporo, Japan. His first experience with computers was in middle school with a demo computer that used telephone lines and with money saved up from a dish-washing job and some additional allowance from his father, Iwata purchased an HP-65, the first programmable calculator, in 1974.</p>
    <p>He obtained his first computer, a Commodore PET, in 1978. He dismantled and studied the machine out of his desire to understand it.  Following high school, Iwata was admitted to the Tokyo Institute of Technology in April 1978, where he majored in computer science, Iwata and several of his friends rented an apartment in Akihabara and soon formed a club where they would create and code games. Classmates living in nearby apartments referred to Iwata's room as "Game Center Iwata". He would frequently show off his games to the Seibu department store's computer department, and by 1980 a group of employees there invited him to join their company, HAL Laboratory Inc.</p>
    <p>During his working period in HAL Laboratory, he worked on simple titles like straight rip-offs of Namco’s Rally-X and Galaxian and when the company got permissions to work on Nintendo Entertainment System titles, he worked on the claimed Earthbound and Kirby titles as well as Ballon fight and NES Open Tournanment Golf (Which future golf titles are now called Mario Golf).</p>
    <p> One of the most remarkable works of Iwata-san is his collaboration in 
      the development of Pokémon Gold and Silver although he was not part of Nintendo at the time.</p>
    <p> In 2000, Iwata took a position at Nintendo as the head of its corporate planning division and took a seat on the board of directors. When Yamauchi, the company's president since 1949, retired on May 24, 2002, Iwata succeeded as Nintendo's fourth president with Yamauchi's blessing.<p>
    
    <h3>What did Iwata-San Achived and what decisions he had to take during his videogame carreer?</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Launched the Nintendo Direct videos and livestreams, as a new method of presenting Nintendo most recent announcments
      </li>
      <li>With his giant knowledge in programming by the time he joined Nintendo, he was able to save projects like Ballon Fight and Earthbound, since their development phases were a mess and the games were unplayable until Iwata-San cooperation with the titles. Other tittles he also cooperated for were:
      </li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
      <li>Super Smash Bros Melee</li>
      <li>Pokemon Gold and Silver</li>
      <li>Mario Kart 8</li>
      <li>Dragon Warrior (Known as Dragon Quest in Japan and future western tittles of the saga)</li>
    </ol>
    <ul>
      <li>Took the Nintendo DS release from his predecesor, Hiroshi Yamauchi,
        and released it November 2004 to face Sony's future handheld, Playstation Portable (PSP), being a great success and a replacement for the Gameboy consoles due to his new dual-screen design and friendly UI, same thing with the Nintendo Wii, one of the best selling consoles of all time.
      </li>
      <li>Due to the poor early times of the Nintendo 3DS, Iwata had to take some dramatic decisions about the console, dropping its price from $249.99 to $169.99 and launching the Nintendo 3DS Ambassador program to give out exclusive retro games to the people who bought the console at original price, with this, Iwata salvaged the Nintendo 3DS from an inminent failure.
      </li>
      <li>As a way of not having to cutoff personel from Nintendo during the rough times (2014-2015), Iwata cutoff his own salary to half, he stated "The company's troubles began at the top, and that's where the punitive measures should begin"
      </li>
        <li>We can say the most important thing Iwata did during his presidency at Nintendo, was maintaining the uniqueness of Nintendo in a market that was growing around mobile gaming, Free-to-play games, HD graphics demand and paid content in-game, even with the rough times for the company, he was able to keep Nintendo on the spot of what differentiate them from other companies, their Family-oriented marketing and games for everyone to enjoy.
      </li>
    </ul>
        <p>Satoru Iwata passed away at age 55 in July 11 2015 due to a tumor in his bile duct, but he left a legacy that will never be forgotten.
